Submitted by: **Selina**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**

## Notes

I had some difficulty setting up the locations of widgets in my app. In the beginning, my app would not show any widgetsâ€”but then I realized that I was hardcoding the margins.
